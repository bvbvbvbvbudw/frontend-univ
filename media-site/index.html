                        of the Moon is ever seen from Earth. This is because the Moon rotates around on its own
                        axis in exactly the same time it takes to orbit the Earth, meaning the same side is always
                        facing the Earth. The side facing away from Earth has only been seen by the human eye from
                        spacecraft.</p>
